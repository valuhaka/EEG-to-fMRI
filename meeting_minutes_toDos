meeting minutes 17.11.2023

@Nadine: 
upload on github:
  - preprocessing scripts (EEG & fMRI)
  - striatal mask (.mat)
  - first level/single subject script (that generates SPM.mat files (see owncloud)) ... in the first level script, you can find how the timings are calculated
upload to owncloud:
  - 5 SPM.mat
  - 5 raw EEG files that are relatively clean
  - dependency files for Luka to run first_level script:
     - WS.mat
     - swuasub-102_ses-1_task_workingmemory_bold.nii file

to do for both:
- try to find single subject timeseries in SPM (should have length ~950 datapoint)
- try to apply binary striatum mask
